## Introduction

This project provides custom spring boot starter projects to simplify bootstrapping microservice applications with
additional features such as emitting events through aspects

## Usage

To opt-in for all of the additional starters and features, add the following dependency to your maven pom file:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>de.gcoding.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>utilities-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively, you can select only the features & starters that you want. See the readme of the desired
starter project for information on how to use them.
